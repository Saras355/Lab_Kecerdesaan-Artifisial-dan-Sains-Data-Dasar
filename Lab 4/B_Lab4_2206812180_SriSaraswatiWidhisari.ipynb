Nilai akurasi\n","- Model kedua (dtc dengan hyperparameter tuning) memiliki akurasi yang lebih tinggi (0.89) daripada model pertama (dtc tanpa fine tuning), yakni 0.65. Ini menunjukkan bahwa model kedua lebih baik dalam melakukan produksi secara keseluruhan. Akurasi menunjukkan seberapa besar persentase dari total sampel yang diklasifikasikan dengan benar oleh model. Melalui confusion matrix, salah satu yang bisa kita lihat, dari nilai diagonal, nilai besar dapat ditemukan di model 2 dibandingkan dengan model 1. Salah satu contohnya adalah data yang diprediksi Insufficient_Weight yang aktualnya adalah Insufficient_Weight pada model 1 adalah 16, dengan yang diklasifikasikan sebagai normal weight adanya sebanyak 8 orang, sedangkan di model kedua adalah 23, dengan kesalahan yang diklasifikasikan sebagai nomral_weight hanya ada 2 data point saja.\n","2. Nilai precision pada model kedua lebih tinggi secara rata-rata (0.893) dibandingkan dengan model pertama (0.716). Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa model kedua cenderung membuat lebih sedikit kesalah dalam mengklasifikasikan sampel negatif seperti positif (sampel yang bukan di kelasnya menjadi ada di suatu kelas). Untuk lebih detailnya kita bisa melihat bahwa pada model kedua rentang nilai precision dari 0.84 sampai 1 ,sedangkan pada model 1 rentangnya bisa dari 0.41 sampai 1.00. Perbandingan yang signifikan adalah model kedua memiliki performa yang lebih bagus (0.84) dibandingkan model pertama (0.41) pada precision kelas Overweight Level II. Ini artinya proporsi orang yang benar-benar masuk ke kelas Overweigth_Level_II dari semua data/kasus yang diprediksi sebagai kelas Overweight Level II di model kedua jauh lebih besar daripada model pertama.\n","3. Nilai recall macro average pada model pertama (0.66) jauh lebih kecil daripada model kedua (0.89). Salah satu exact performa yang diambil adalah recall untuk kelas Obestiy_Type_I pada model 1 sebesar 0.27, berbanding jauh dengan skor di model 2 sebesar 0.95. Ini menunjukkan model 2 lebih baik dalam mengklasifikasikan suatu data point ke dalam kelas Obesity Type iI diantara data-data yang masuk pada kelas Obesity Type I keseluruhan.\n","4. Nilai F1-Score merupakan fair average antara nilai recall dan precision, jika dilihat dari nilai F1 Macro average, skor pada model 2 sebesar 0.89, nilai ini jauh lebih besar daripada di model 1 yang hanya sebesar 0.65. Nilai F1 ini masuk akal mengingat nilai recall dan precision di model 2 memang jauh lebih besar, membuat nilai F1 score juga semakin besar. Ini menunjukkan model 2 lebih memiliki performa yang bagus dalam mengklasifikasikan data ke dalam kelas seharusnya, dibandingkan performa model 1.\n","5. Secara keseluruhan, nilai untuk tiap meter (accuracy, F1 Macro average, F1 Micro Average, Precision Macro Average, Precision Micro Average, Recall Macro Average, dan Recall Micro Average) lebih bagus skornya di model kedua daripada model pertama ini dikarenakan adanya hyperparameter tuning.

Bootstrapping adalah teknik yang digunakan pada Random Forest, merupakan teknik pengambilan sampel acak dari dataset dengan pengembalian. Set data latih dapat muncul beberapa kali pada decision tree yang dibangun atau tidak muncul sama sekali dalam setiap sampel bootstrap. Bootstrapping berkontribusi pada keragaman dari berbagai decision tree yang terbentuk dalam Random Forest dengan dua cara utama:\n","- Random Forest melakukan pemilihan fitur acak untuk setiap deicsion tree yang dbangun. Karena adanya pengacakan ini, ini membuat model Random Forest lebih memperkenalkan banyak variasi dan diversitas di tiap decision treenya.\n","- Random forest menggunakan dataset train yang berbeda untuk setiap decision tree yang dibangun.

Pada kasus prediksi kelas obesity risk pada lab 4, yang merupakan masalah klasifikasi multiclass, penggunaan random forest dapat dengan mudah digunakan untuk masalah ini. Random forest menggunakan dua metode, yakni metode One-vs-All (OvA) atau One-vs-Rest (OvR), serta metode One-vs-One (OvO). Namun, dari library sklearn.ensemble, random forest classifier yang ada secara default menggunakan One-vs-aLL atau One-vs-Rest.\n","Pada metode OvA atau OvR, tiap kelas akan diidentifikasikan sebagai kelas positif, sedangkan semua kelas lainnya diidentifikasikan sebagai kelas negatif. Kemudian, random forest melatih satu decision tree untuk setiap kelasnya, dan membedakan antara kelas positif dan semau kelas negatif lainnya. Hasil prediksi kelas merupakan kelas dengan probabilitas tertinggi dari semua decisin tree yang dibagun.\n","* Contoh:\n","* Terdapat 3 kelas: A,B, dan C. Pada metode OvA, dibangun 3 decision tree. Tree A akan membedakan antara kelas A dan non-A Tree b membedakan antara kelas B dan non-B. dan tree C akan membedakan antara kelas C dan non-C.\n","* Contoh berdasarkan dataset:\n","- ada 7 jenis kelas, yakni :\n","Underweight (Berat Kurang)\n","Normal Weight (Berat Normal)\n","Obesity Type I (Obesitas Tipe I)\n","Obesity Type II (Obesitas Tipe II)\n","Obesity Type III (Obesitas Tipe III)\n","Overweight Level I (Kelebihan Berat Badan Tingkat I)\n","Overweight Level II (Kelebihan Berat Badan Tingkat II)\n","\n","\n","1. Langkah awal adalah penentuan kelas positif dan negatif. Dalam OvA, tiap kelas obesitas yang ada, kita perlakukan sebagai kelas positif sedangkan semua kelas lainnya dianggap sebagai kelas negatif. Misalnya a, untuk kelas Underweight (Berat Kurang), kelas ini akan dianggap sebagai kelas positif, sedangkan semua kelas lainnya (Normal Weight, Obesity Type I, dst.) akan dianggap sebagai kelas negatif.\n","2. Pelatihan model untuk setiap kelas\n","Setelah menentukan kelas positif dan negatif, kita akan melatih satu model untuk klasifikasi tiap kelas obesitas. Misalnya, untuk kelas Underweight, kita akan melatih satu model yang bertujuan untuk membedakan antara sampel yang termasuk dalam kelas Underweight dan yang tidak. Model ini akan belajar untuk membedakan antara Underweight dan semua kelas lainnya.\n","3. Prediksi kelas dengan probabilitas tertinggi\n","Setelah melatih moodle untuk tiap kelas, kita akan melakuk prediksi dengan sampel baru dengan menggunakan semua model yang telah dilatih.

Dari evaluasi perform pada nomor 6 untuk keempat model menunjukkan bahwa penggunaan hyperparameter tuning telah meningkatkan performa keseluruhan model dalam beberapa kasus, antara lain:\n","- Random Forest Regressor. Setelah melakukan hyperparameter tuning, terjadi peningkatan pada nilai R2 dari sekitar 0.83 menjadi sekitar 0.87. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa pengaturan hyperparameter yang optimal telah meningkatkan kemampuan model untuk menjelaskan variasi dalam data, sehingga kinerja keseluruhan model dalam memprediksi nilai target dapat meningkat.\n","- Random Forest Classifier. Dalam kasus ini, terdapat peningkatkan pada nilai akurasi dari sekitar 0.78 menjadi sekitar 0.81 setelah melakukan hyperparameter tuning. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa hyperparameter yang tepat, model random forest dapat membuat prediksi yang lebih akurat dalam mengklasifikasikan sampel ke dalam kelas yang tepat.\n","- Decision Tree Regressor. Hasil hyperparameter tuning tidak terlalu menunjukkan peningkatan yang signifikan untuk kinerja model. Hal ini bisa saja disebabkan oleh sifat sederhana dari Decision Tree yang cenderung overfitting pada data latih, tetapi hyperparameter disini masih penting untuk memastikan bahwa model memiliki penyesuaian yang optimal terhadap karakteristik data.\n","- Decision Tree Classifier. Sama seperti decision tree regressor, hasil hyperparameter tuning pada model ini tidak terlalu menunjukkan peningkatan yang signifikan dalam kinerja model. Meskipun begitu, proses tuning tetap penting untuk memastikan bahwa model mempunyai kesimbangan yang baik antara bias dan varians.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["2. Random forest memasukkan unsur randomness melalui dua mekanisme utama, yakni bootstrapping dan feature selection. Bootstrapping menggunakan pengambil sampel acak dengan pergantian dari dataset latih, sedangkan feature selection menggunakan pemilihan subset fitur acak untuk setiap split dalam decision tree. Unsur randomness ini dapat berpengaruh pada reprodusibilitas hasil dan variasi dalam model. Random forest yang membanyan banyak decision tree berbeda secara acak, memungkikan hasil dari model ini dapat bervariasi dari satu pelatihan kepelatihan lainnya. Ini dapat terjadi karena perbedaan dalam sampel pada proses bootstrapping yang dihasilkan secara acak dan perbedaan dalam subset fitur yang dipertimbangankan.\n","Variasi dalam model ini dapat menyebabkan hasil yang tidak konsisten untuk setiap percobaan yang berbeda.
